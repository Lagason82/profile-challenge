## Overview

having fun designing the page just by gauging the preview jpg file. this time trying to familiarize the html semantec by adding section.

### The challenge

centering the grid to middle, still not get use to do flex on the main body. instead opted to add div and using obsolute position to align the content


## My process

- as a newbie, checking the design section is the first thing to do, and then going the requirement section where color etc are given
- replace the button with anchor following the design, no button element were use here
- combination of flex - position obsolute to center the grid content
- adding all the required content before styling

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

Working with this project enchancing my understanding on the css position which I have been in lack with. learning using rem instead of px really opened my eye on how powerfull rem is.


### Continued development

I will focus more on css property, as to deepen my understanding on inline, inline block technique, will be majoring on commerce Website too.
